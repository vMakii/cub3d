Mon premier RayCaster avec la minilibX

FIX:
- ennemies movement (they sometimes go back instead of going toward the player, especially zombies)

Roadmap:
- keybinds print
- fluid animation based on time and not fps
- headbobbing
- mana and stamina logic and bars on screen
- change map def:
    * sort sprites assets and enemies per map
    * place ennemies manually on map
    * multiple map interconnected / or 1 big map with differents assets.
    * get items from sprites (potions, weapons, ...)
        + maybe even inventory
- save and load
- create and improve textures
- pause ingame (with options?)
- endgame and win screen
- new spells (fire ball, sparks, ...)
- storyline after start new game
- sounds ?
